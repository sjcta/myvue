<div class="Section">
  <p class="TextStyle1">Tokyo, Japan, April 18, 2016 -- Hitachi, Ltd. (TSE:6501, "Hitachi") today announced that Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital ("HKSH") has selected Hitachi to supply a two-treatment gantry proton beam therapy ("PBT") system through its subsidiary company, Million Hope International Limited ("MHI"), for their facility, the first in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The order includes a 10-year contract for service and maintenance.</p>

  <p class="TextStyle1">The PBT system will be installed in HKSH Eastern District Advanced Medical Centre where the synchrotron-based accelerator has been positioned above the two treatment rooms in a space-saving, vertically-stacked design, ideal for tight, urban areas such as Hong Kong. The treatment rooms will be equipped with rotating gantries capable of treating patients with Hitachi's Spot Scanning technology and is expected to be operational by 2020, marking Hitachi's first PBT system order in Hong Kong. This system is expected to become the model case to install PBT system in dense metropolitan cities.</p>

  <p class="TextStyle1">Established in 1922, HKSH is a leading private hospital in a city well-known for the quality of its healthcare and is ranked among the best hospitals in Asia. It leads in advanced medical technologies, nursing care (with the oldest nursing school in the city),and patient-centric care, often regarded as the model of care within China. The new Advanced Medical Centre is part of HKSH's expansion in eastern Hong Kong Island,consists of a 17-story clinical building on top of Hitachi's underground PBT facility.</p>

  <p class="TextStyle1">In December 2007, Hitachi was the first company in the world to clear U.S. FDA Premarket Notification Special 510(k) for spot scanning irradiation technology with Hitachi's PBT system. Hitachi then proceeded to build advanced proton systems for the largest cancer center in the world, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (May 2008), for the Nagoya Proton Therapy Center (September 2013), and for the Hokkaido University Hospital Proton Beam Therapy Center (March 2014). In fiscal year 2015, three additional centers have also begun treatments in the United States.</p>

  <p class="TextStyle1">Over 10,000 patients have been treated with Hitachi's PBT systems, in part due to the high clinical availability of systems maintained by long term service protocols which have been refined over years of experience at world-class facilities. Hitachi continues to be the vendor of choice by those who value the firm's proven credibility at sites across the world.</p>

  <p class="TextStyle1">Mr. Wyman LI, Manager（Administration）of Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital and Chief Operation Officer of Million Hope International, stated, "Our new facility will now be capable of one of the most advanced forms of cancer treatment, the first in Hong Kong. The Hitachi system, already in operation at world-class centers in Japan and in the United States, will allow us to provide highly sophisticated and effective treatment that has been previously unavailable in this region. We are eager to deliver this life-saving solution in partnership with a company of highest repute and esteemed users, reflecting our commitment to patients through our motto: 'Quality in Service Excellence in Care.'"</p>

  <p class="TextStyle1">Mr. Masaya Watanabe, Vice President and Executive Officer, CEO of Hitachi's Healthcare Business Unit stated, "It is truly an honor for us to supply our PBT system to Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital, known widely for the quality of their medical services. This project is unique in several ways. Not only does it represent the first PBT system in Hong Kong, but the planned facility can also showcase PBT implementation in dense, urban areas. We are confident that this partnership with Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital will further promote advanced cancer treatment within Asia."</p>

  <p class="TextStyle1">Hitachi will continue to globally expand the healthcare business where PBT is its flagship solution and contribute to cancer treatment around the world.</p>

<h2><span>Overview of Proton Beam Therapy</span></h2>
  <p class="TextStyle1">Proton Beam Therapy is an advanced form of external beam radiotherapy. Protons from hydrogen atoms are extracted and accelerated up to 70% the speed of light. Its energy is concentrated directly on the tumor while significantly decreasing radiation dose to surrounding healthy tissues. PBT improves the quality of life for cancer patients since they experience almost no pain during treatment and the procedure has very few side effects compared with that of traditional radiotherapy. In most cases, patients can continue with their normal daily activities while undergoing treatment. Because there are fewer side effects, PBT now becomes one of the most advanced cancer treatments.</p>

<div class="Section">
<h2><span>Overview of Spot-Scanning Irradiation Technology</span></h2>
  <p class="TextStyle1">Spot-scanning irradiation technology does not scatter proton beams as with conventional proton beam therapy. Rather, it repeatedly turns a narrow proton beam on and off at high speed as it progressively changes location to irradiate entire tumor volumes. Protons can be aimed with high precision according to the targeted tumors,even those with complex shapes, while minimizing the impact on nearby healthy tissue.Furthermore, customized equipment such as collimators and boluses are not required.</p>
